Lync Common Area Phone Management Tool (GUI)
============================================

            


I created this tool to allow you to add, modify, and remove Lync common area phones with an easy to use graphical front end.  This functionality is not available within the Lync Control Panel and even modifications via the Lync Management Shell can be
 difficult or time consuming.


Because this is the initial release of the tool, you may find bugs and not all errors are being caught.  Before you rate this, if you find any issues or have any usability improvements, please suggest them in the Q/A section and I will address them. 
 If you like it right out of the box, please rate it with 5 stars.  :)


My own future thoughts for improvement include a multi-select mode where you could select multiple phones and modify them as a group.  Let me know if you'd like to see this implemented.


This tool will load fastest when triggered from a Lync Management Shell prompt.  As with any free tool you find on the Internet, use at your own risk.


Thank you!
